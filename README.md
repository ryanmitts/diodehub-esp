# DiodeHub ESP32 Firmware

[DiodeHub](https://diodehub.com) ESP32 firmware.

Firmware to run on an ESP32 WiFi module to drive individually addressable light strips, like the WS2812B, that can be controlled over the internet.

The ESP32 chip connects using HTTPS to a WebSocket server where light control messages can be sent from the internet.

I am making this to work specifically with my site, [DiodeHub](https://diodehub.com), but the source code is here that you could setup your own server solution to have the lights connect to if you follow the API to talk to the ESP module over the socket.
